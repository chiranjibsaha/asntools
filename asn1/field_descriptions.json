Only if this field is present, the UE indicates NR-DC support for band combinations for which it supports the requested cell grouping, i.e., in which it supports at least one of the mcg bands on MCG and at least one of the scg bands on the SCG. In its supportedBandCombinationList, the UE indicates which of its NR-DC band combinations supports which of the requested cell groupings. The first element in this list is referred to by ID#0, the second by ID#1 and so on. If this field is absent, the UE only includes band combinations for which it supports NR-DC with only FR1 bands in MCG and only FR2 bands in SCG. Example 1: requestedCellGrouping is set to mcg=[n1, n7, n41, n66] and scg=[n78, n261]. This assumes that the NW would always use CA among n1, n7, n41 and n66 (depending on which are deployed on a given site) whereas with n78 and/or n261 the NW may need to use DC. With this filter a UE may report a band combination n1A-n7A-n78A for NR-DC only if it supports that serving cells for n1 and n7 are in the MCG and a serving cell for n78 is in the SCG. The UE may also report a band combination n41C-n261M for NR-DC provided that it supports a serving cell for n41 in the MCG and a serving cell for n261 in the SCG. Example 2: One requestedCellGrouping is set to mcg=[n1, n7, n41, n66] and scg=[n78, n261] and another requestedCellGrouping is set to mcg=[n1, n7, n66] and scg=[ n41, n78, n261]. This assumes that the NW uses sometimes CA among n1, n7, n41 and n66 (as in example 1) and sometimes CA among n1, n7 and n66 but DC towards one or several of n41, n78, n261. If a UE supports n1A-n41A-n78A only if n41A and n78A are in the same cell group, this UE may only indicate cell grouping ID#1 (not #0) in its BC.",
