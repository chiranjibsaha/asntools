*SIB1 *field descriptions

***barringExemptEmergencyCall***

Indicates whether the cell allows emergency bearer services for UEs who would otherwise consider the cell as barred as specified in TS 38.304 [20].

***cellBarred2RxXR***

Value *barred *means that the cell is barred for a 2Rx XR UE indicating *supportOf2RxXR *for the selected="selected" frequency band as specified in clause 5.2.2.4.2. This field is ignored by all UEs not indicating *supportOf2RxXR *for the selected="selected" frequency band. This field may be configured only if the cell operates in a frequency band where 4Rx antenna ports are mandated as specified in TS 38.101-1 [15]. If this field is absent on a cell operating in a frequency band where 4RX antenna ports are mandated, a 2RX XR UE shall treat the cell as not barred, as specified in TS 38.304 [20].

***cellBarred******ATG***

Value *barred* means that the cell is barred for connectivity to ATG, as defined in TS 38.304 [20]. Value *notBarred* means that the cell is allowed for connectivity to ATG.
