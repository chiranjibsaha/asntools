#### –     *FeatureCombinationPreambles* [#](#featurecombinationpreambles)

The IE* FeatureCombinationPreambles *associates* *a set of preambles with a feature combination. For parameters which can be provided in this IE, the UE applies this field value when performing Random Access using a preamble in this featureCombinationPreambles, otherwise the UE applies the corresponding value as determined by applicable Need Code, e.g. Need S. On a specific BWP, there can be at most one set of preambles associated with a given feature combination per RA Type (i.e. 4-step RACH or 2-step RACH) per MSG1 repetition number.

*FeatureCombinationPreambles** *field descriptions

***deltaPreamble***

Power offset between msg3 or msgA-PUSCH and RACH preamble transmission. If configured, this parameter overrides *msg3-DeltaPreamble* or *msgA-DeltaPreamble*, Actual value = field value * 2 [dB] (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 7.1). If *msgA-DeltaPreamble* is configured in *separateMsgA-PUSCH-Config-r17*, this field is absent. This field is set to the same value for all *FeatureCombinationPreambles* for MSG1 repetitions.

***featureCombination***

Indicates which combination of features that the preambles indicated by this IE are associated with. Network ensures that at least one field within the *featureCombination* is configured. The UE ignores a RACH resource defined by this *FeatureCombinationPreambles* if any feature within the *featureCombination* is not supported by the UE or if any of the spare fields within the *featureCombination* is set to *true*.

***messagePowerOffsetGroupB***

Threshold for preamble selection. Value is in dB. Value *minusinfinity* corresponds to –infinity. Value *dB0* corresponds to 0 dB, *dB5* corresponds to 5 dB and so on (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.1.2).

***msg1-RepetitionNum***

Indicates which MSG1-repetition number that this *FeatureCombinationPreambles* is associated with.

***msg1-RepetitionTimeOffsetROGroup***

Indicates a time offset of the starting ROs between two successive RO groups for a given repetition number (2, 4 or 8) associated with this *FeatureCombinationPreambles* for each frequency resource index within a time period (see TS 38.213 [13]). If this field is absent, the time offset is implicitly determined (see TS 38.213 [13]).

 

For each MSG1 repetition number, the following values are applicable.

•    {n16}, for RO groups for MSG1 repetition number 8

•    {n8, n16}, for RO groups for MSG1 repetition number 4

•    {n4, n8, n16}, for RO groups for MSG1 repetition number 2

***msgA-RSRP-Threshold***

The UE selects 2-step random access type to perform random access based on this threshold (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.1.1). This field is only present if both 2-step and 4-step RA type are configured for the concerned feature combination in the BWP. If configured, this parameter overrides *msgA-RSRP-Threshold-r16*. If absent, the UE applies *msgA-RSRP-Threshold-r16*, if configured

***numberOfPreambles******PerSSB-******ForThisPartition***

It determines how many consecutive preambles are associated to the Feature Combination starting from the starting preamble(s) per SSB.

***numberOfRA-PreamblesGroupA***

It determines how many consecutive preambles per SSB are associated to Group A starting from the starting preamble(s). The remaining preambles associated to the Feature Combination are associated to Group B

***ra-SizeGroupA***

Transport Blocks size threshold in bits below which the UE shall use a contention-based RA preamble of group A. (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.1.2). If this feature combination preambles are associated to a *RACH-ConfigCommon-twostepRA*, this field correspond to *ra-MsgA-SizeGroupA*, otherwise it corresponds to *ra-Msg3SizeGroupA*.

***rsrp-ThresholdSSB***

UE may select the SS block and corresponding PRACH resource for path-loss estimation and (re)transmission based on SS blocks that satisfy the threshold (see TS 38.213 [13]). If this parameter is included in *FeatureCombinationPreambles* which is included in *RACH-ConfigCommonTwoStepRA*, it corresponds to *msgA-RSRP-ThresholdSSB*, as defined in TS 38.321 [3]. If this parameter is included in *FeatureCombinationPreambles* which is included in *RACH-ConfigCommon*, it it corresponds to *rsrp-ThresholdSSB*, as defined in TS 38.321 [3]. If this parameter is not included in *FeatureCombinationPreambles* which is included in *RACH-ConfigCommon*, the UE applies *rsrp-ThresholdSSB* included in the *RACH-ConfigCommon *which includes this* FeatureCombinationPreambles*. If this parameter is not included in *FeatureCombinationPreambles* which is included in *RACH-ConfigCommonTwoStepRA*, the UE applies *msgA-RSRP-ThresholdSSB* included in the *RACH-ConfigCommonTwoStepRA** *which includes this* FeatureCombinationPreambles*.

***separateMsgA-PUSCH-Config***

If present, it specifies how the 2-step RACH preambles identified by this *FeatureCombinationPreambles* are mapped to a PUSCH slot separate from the one defined in MsgA-ConfigCommon-r16. If the field is absent, the UE should apply the corresponding parameter in the *RACH-ConfigCommonTwoStepRA *of the BWP which includes the* FeatureCombinationPreambles IE*.

***ssb-SharedRO-MaskIndex***

Mask index (see TS 38.321 [3]).

Indicates a subset of ROs where preambles are allocated for this feature combination.

If this field is configured within *FeatureCombinationPreambles* which is included in *RACH-ConfigCommonTwoStepRA*:

-     in case of separate ROs are configured for 4-step and 2-step random access, this field indicates a subset of ROs configured within this *RACH-ConfigCommonTwoStepRA*;

-     in case shared ROs are used for 4-step and 2-step random access, it indicates the subset of ROs configured within *RACH-ConfigCommon*, which are the subset of ROs configured for 2-step random access.

This field is configured when there is more than one RO per SSB. If the field is absent, all ROs configured in *RACH-ConfigCommon* or *RACH-ConfigCommonTwoStepRA* containing this *FeatureCombinationPreambles* are shared. The network does not configure this field, if the field *msg1-RepetitionNum* is configured.

***startPreambleForThisPartition***

It defines the first preamble associated with the Feature Combination. If the UE is provided with a number N of SSB block indexes associated with one PRACH occasion, and N<1, the first preamble in each PRACH occasion is the one having the same index as indicated by this field. If N>=1, N blocks of preambles associated with the Feature Combination are defined, each having start index + *startPreambleForThisPartition*, where n refers to SSB block index (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 8.1).

 

Conditional Presence

Explanation

*MsgAConfigCommon*

The field is optionally present, Need S, if *FeatureCombinationPreambles* is included in *RACH-ConfigCommonTwoStepRA*. Otherwise, it is absent. If the field is absent in *FeatureCombinationPreambles* included in *RACH-ConfigCommonTwoStepRA*, the UE applies *MsgA-PUSCH-Config* included in the corresponding *MsgA-ConfigCommon*.

*Msg1Rep2*

The field is mandatory present, if *msg1-Repetitions* is included in *FeatureCombination* for this concerned *FeatureCombinationPreambles*. Otherwise, it is absent.

*Msg1Rep3*

The field is optionally present, Need S, if *msg1-Repetitions* is included in *FeatureCombination* for this concerned *FeatureCombinationPreambles*. Otherwise, it is absent.
