    "additionalRACH-Config": "List of feature or feature combination-specific RACH configurations, i.e. the RACH configurations configured in addition to the one configured by rach-ConfigCommon and by msgA-ConfigCommon. The network associates all possible preambles of an additional RACH configuration to one or more feature(s) or feature combination(s). The network does not configure this list to have more than 16 entries. If both rach-ConfigCommon and msgA-ConfigCommon are configured for a specific FeatureCombination, the network always provides them in the same additionalRACH-Config.",
    "additionalRACH-perPCI-ToAddModList": "List of RACH configurations for the additional PCIs. The RACH configuration for an additional PCI is applied for Random Access procedure initiated by PDCCH order towards to the additional PCI, as specified in TS 38.321 clause 5.1.1b. This list includes the same number of elements like additionalPCI-ToAddModList for this serving cell and the n-th element of this list is for the PCI in the n-th element of additionalPCI-ToAddModList. Either the network does not configure any RACH configuration for any additional PCI, or the network configures a RACH configuration for each additional PCI. When the network releases an additional PCI of a serving cell, the network also explicitly releases the associated random access configuration in every UL BWP of the serving cell. This configuration may be different for different UEs.",
    "enableRA-PrioritizationForSlicing": "Indicates whether or not the ra-PrioritizationForSlicing/ra-PrioritizationForSlicingTwoStep should override the ra-PrioritizationForAccessIdentity. The field is applicable only when the UE is configured by upper layers with both NSAG and Access Identity 1 or 2. If value TRUE is configured, the UE should only apply the ra-PrioritizationForSlicing/ra-PrioritizationForSlicingTwoStep. If value FALSE is configured, the UE should only apply ra-PrioritizationForAccessIdentity. If the field is absent, whether to use ra-PrioritizationForSlicing/ra-PrioritizationForSlicingTwoStep or ra-PrioritizationForAccessIdentity is up to UE implementation.",
    "mcs-Msg3-Repetitions": "Configuration of eight candidate MCS indexes for PUSCH transmission scheduled by RAR UL grant and DCI format 0_0 with CRC scrambled by TC-RNTI. Only the first 4 configured or default MCS indexes are used for PUSCH transmission scheduled by RAR UL grant. This field is only applicable when the UE selects Random Access resources indicating Msg3 repetition in this BWP. If this field is absent when the set(s) of Random Access resources with MSG3 repetition indication are configured in the BWP-UplinkCommon, the UE shall apply the values {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 6.1.4).",
    "msgA-ConfigCommon": "Configuration of the cell specific PRACH and PUSCH resource parameters for transmission of MsgA in 2-step random access type procedure. The NW can configure msgA-ConfigCommon only for UL BWPs if the linked DL BWPs (same bwp-Id as UL-BWP) are the initial DL BWPs or DL BWPs containing the SSB associated to the initial DL BWP or DL BWPs associated with nonCellDefiningSSB or, for (e)RedCap UEs, the RedCap-specific initial downlink BWP. The network configures msgA-ConfigCommon (without suffix) and/or msgA-ConfigCommon-r17, whenever it configures contention free 2-step random access, the UE then applies the corresponding configuration depending on the RACH resource set selected=\"selected\" upon RACH initialization, as specified in TS 38.321 [3].",
    "numberOfMsg3-RepetitionsList": "The number of repetitions for PUSCH transmission scheduled by RAR UL grant and DCI format 0_0 with CRC scrambled by TC-RNTI. This field is only applicable when the UE selects Random Access resources indicating Msg3 repetition in this BWP. If this field is absent when the set(s) of Random Access resources with MSG3 repetition indication are configured in the BWP-UplinkCommon, the UE shall apply the values {n1, n2, n3, n4} (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 6.1.2.1).",
    "preambleTransMax-Msg1-Repetition": "Max number of transmissions of MSG1 repetitions number (2, 4 and 8) performed before switching to higher repetition number (see TS 38.321 [3], clauses 5.1.1). This field is only applicable when more than one repetition numbers are configured in shared RO. If the field is absent, switching from lower repetition number to higher repetition number is not allowed.",
    "pucch-ConfigCommon": "Cell specific parameters for the PUCCH of this BWP.",
    "pusch-ConfigCommon": "Cell specific parameters for the PUSCH of this BWP.",
    "rach-ConfigCommon": "Configuration of cell specific random access parameters which the UE uses for contention based and contention free random access as well as for contention based beam failure recovery in this BWP. The NW configures SSB-based RA (and hence RACH-ConfigCommon) only for UL BWPs if the linked DL BWPs (same bwp-Id as UL-BWP) are the initial DL BWPs or DL BWPs containing the SSB associated to the initial DL BWP or DL BWPs associated with nonCellDefiningSSB or, for (e)RedCap UEs, the RedCap-specific initial downlink BWP. The network configures rach-ConfigCommon (without suffix) and/or rach-ConfigCommon-r17, whenever it configures contention free 4-step random access (e.g. for reconfiguration with sync or for beam failure recovery or PDCCH order), the UE then applies the corresponding configuration depending on the RACH resource set selected=\"selected\" upon RACH initialization, as specified in TS 38.321 [3]. For RedCap-specific initial uplink BWP, rach-ConfigCommon is always configured when msgA-ConfigCommon is configured in this BWP.",

The value applies to all the BWPs and all RACH configurations. For a given MSG1 repetition number, this corresponding field is mandatory if both set(s) of Random Access resources with MSG1 repetition indication associated with this MSG1 repetition number and set(s) of Random Access resources without MSG1 repetition indication are configured in the BWP, or if the set(s) of Random Access resources with MSG1 repetition indication associated with this MSG1 repetition number and set(s) of Random Access resources with MSG1 repetition indication associated with a lower repetition number are configured in the BWP. It is absent otherwise.",
