  "fields": {
    "featureCombinationPreambles": "Specifies a series of preamble partitions each associated to a combination of features and 4-step RA. The network does not configure this list to have more than 16 entries.",
    "messagePowerOffsetGroupB": "Threshold for preamble selection. Value is in dB. Value minusinfinity corresponds to –infinity. Value dB0 corresponds to 0 dB, dB5 corresponds to 5 dB and so on (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.1.2). This field is set to the same value for different repetition numbers associated with a specific FeatureCombination.",
    "msg1-SubcarrierSpacing": "Subcarrier spacing of PRACH (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 5.3.2). Only the following values are applicable depending on the used frequency: FR1:    15 or 30 kHz FR2-1/FR2-NTN:  60 or 120 kHz FR2-2:  120, 480, or 960 kHz If absent, the UE applies the SCS as derived from the prach-ConfigurationIndex in RACH-ConfigGeneric (see tables Table 6.3.3.1-1, Table 6.3.3.1-2, Table 6.3.3.2-2 and Table 6.3.3.2-3, TS 38.211 [16]). The value also applies to contention free random access (RACH-ConfigDedicated), to SI-request and to contention-based beam failure recovery (CB-BFR). But it does not apply for contention free beam failure recovery (CF-BFR) (see BeamFailureRecoveryConfig).",
    "msg3-transformPrecoder": "Enables the transform precoder for Msg3 transmission according to clause 6.1.3 of TS 38.214 [19]. If the field is absent, the UE disables the transformer precoder (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 8.3).",
    "numberOfRA-PreamblesGroupA": "The number of CB preambles per SSB in group A. This determines implicitly the number of CB preambles per SSB available in group B. (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.1.1). The setting should be consistent with the setting of ssb-perRACH-OccasionAndCB-PreamblesPerSSB.",
    "prach-RootSequenceIndex": "PRACH root sequence index (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 6.3.3.1). The value range depends on whether L=839 or L=139 or L=571 or L=1151. The length of the root sequence corresponding with the index indicated in this IE should be consistent with the one indicated in prach-ConfigurationIndex in the RACH-ConfigDedicated (if configured). If prach-RootSequenceIndex-r16 is signalled, UE shall ignore the prach-RootSequenceIndex (without suffix). For FR2-2, only the following values are applicable depending on the used subcarrier spacing: 120 kHz:  L=139, L=571, and L=1151 480 kHz:  L=139, and L=571 960 kHz:  L=139",
    "ra-ContentionResolutionTimer": "The initial value for the contention resolution timer (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.1.5). Value sf8 corresponds to 8 subframes, value sf16 corresponds to 16 subframes, and so on.",
    "ra-Msg3SizeGroupA": "Transport Blocks size threshold in bits below which the UE shall use a contention-based RA preamble of group A (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.1.2). This field is set to the same value for different repetition numbers associated with a specific FeatureCombination.",
    "ra-Prioritization": "Parameters which apply for prioritized random access procedure on any UL BWP of SpCell for specific Access Identities (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.1.1a).",
    "ra-PrioritizationForAI": "Indicates whether the field ra-Prioritization-r16 applies for Access Identities. The first/leftmost bit corresponds to Access Identity 1, the next bit corresponds to Access Identity 2. Value 1 indicates that the field ra-Prioritization-r16 applies otherwise the field does not apply (see TS 23.501 [32]).",
    "ra-PrioritizationForSlicing": "Parameters which apply to configure prioritized CBRA 4-step random access type for slicing.",
    "rach-ConfigGeneric": "RACH parameters for both regular random access and beam failure recovery.",
    "restrictedSetConfig": "Configuration of an unrestricted set or one of two types of restricted sets, see TS 38.211 [16], clause 6.3.3.1.",
    "rsrp-ThresholdSSB": "UE may select the SS block and corresponding PRACH resource for path-loss estimation and (re)transmission based on SS blocks that satisfy the threshold (see TS 38.213 [13]).",
    "rsrp-ThresholdSSB-SUL": "The UE selects SUL carrier to perform random access based on this threshold (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.1.1). The value applies to all the BWPs and all RACH configurations.",
    "ssb-perRACH-OccasionAndCB-PreamblesPerSSB": "The meaning of this field is twofold: the CHOICE conveys the information about the number of SSBs per RACH occasion. Value oneEighth corresponds to one SSB associated with 8 RACH occasions, value oneFourth corresponds to one SSB associated with 4 RACH occasions, and so on. The ENUMERATED part indicates the number of Contention Based preambles per SSB. Value n4 corresponds to 4 Contention Based preambles per SSB, value n8 corresponds to 8 Contention Based preambles per SSB, and so on. The total number of CB preambles in a RACH occasion is given by CB-preambles-per-SSB * max(1, SSB-per-rach-occasion). See TS 38.213 [13].",
    "totalNumberOfRA-Preambles": "Total number of preambles used for contention based and contention free 4-step or 2-step random access in the RACH resources defined in RACH-ConfigCommon, excluding preambles used for other purposes (e.g. for SI request). If the field is absent, all 64 preambles are available for RA. The setting should be consistent with the setting of ssb-perRACH-OccasionAndCB-PreamblesPerSSB, i.e. it should be a multiple=\"multiple\" of the number of SSBs per RACH occasion."
